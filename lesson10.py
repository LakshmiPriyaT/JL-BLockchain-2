# 1. Inside the .proof_of_work() method, create a local variable proof and assign it the blockâ€™s hash.

# 2. Finish the rest of the method by creating a loop that increments the nonce value until the hash with the required difficulty has been generated. After finding the correct hash, set the value of the block.nonce back to 0 and return the correct hash outside of the loop.
